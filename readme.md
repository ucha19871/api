 send post request to this end point with following data 
 **Endpoint:** `api/register`
 
 ```json
{
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email" : "info@example.com",
    "password" : "password",
    "phone" : "555000730",
    "bio" : "About yourself (optional)",
    "image" : "http://lorempixel.com/128/128/",        
}
 ```
 - After registering a username, authorize with your credentials  
 **Endpoint:** `api/auth`
```json
    {
     "email" : "demo@example.com",
     "password" : "12345"
    }
```
 > This action will give you a token which will be used to access other endpoints.
 > You should pass **Authorization** header with **Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...**
